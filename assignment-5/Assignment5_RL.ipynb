This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V^*$ which satisfies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the RHS of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what action $a$ achieves the maximum on the RHS of the Bellman equation applied to $V^*$. The process of repeated application of the Bellman equation is what we here call the _value iteration_ algorithm."
