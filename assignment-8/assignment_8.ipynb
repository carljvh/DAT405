This is done recursively throughout the whole tree in order to find the shortest path in the graph. If the last node to be visited in our tree is our goal, we will have visited $\\sum_{0}^{r}d^r$ nodes, if we take each visit to correspond to one iteration of BFS.\n",

Next, we assume that a path is defined as following the edges of the lowest cost from a parent node into one of the child nodes and its grandchildren recursively, until the cost of the path becomes equal to or higher than the cost of following the edges of one of the other child nodes.

The reason for this is that, unlike A* and Best-first search, BFS implements a simple unprioritized queue in order to keep track of the nodes to visit, meaning that it visits all the closest nodes first, then the child nodes, then the grandchild nodes, etc. As can be viewed in the visualization, the visited nodes spread out uniformly from the source node until the shortest path is found. The A* algorithm performs the next best, but worse than Best-first search, because it makes use of the cost of the path $g(n)$ as well as a heuristic function $h(n)$ in order to minimize combined the value of the two. In this case, the cost is uniform for all steps which makes the cost function redundant. In addition, if backwards flow is prohibited there are no infinite loops to get stuck in, thus removing one of the potential pitfalls of using Best-first search."

    "The reason why the BFS outperforms the GBFS in this case is that the BFS search for a globally optimal solution to the problem, which is why it is slower in general. In contrast, the GBFS only searches for a locally optimal solution since the queue implemented prioritizes nodes that are closer to the goal, a behaviour which is compounded, as in the next generation of nodes, some will be even closer to the goal. As the heuristic is based on knowing some facts about the environment of the problem, the GBFS is useful when you have some notion of where to search for your solution."
